This repository contains code to recreate the figures from "Limiting hearing loss in transgenic mouse models" by Babola, Donovan, Darcy, and Kanold (2024-ish). Each figure is broken into it's own folder, with subsequent panels indicated in the file name.

In order to succesfully recreate figures, the corresponding data must be placed within the repository folder. It can be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13761405). If a custom data location is desired, this can be specified in the [config file.](/Code/Travis/config.py).
